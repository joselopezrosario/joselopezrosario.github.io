Hello, my name is Jose. I enjoy working with people and finding solutions to complex technical problems. I'm here to help you learn how to develop applications with my favorite platforms: Oracle APEX and FileMaker Pro.

My teaching method is direct and practical. I state the goal in the introduction, show you the result, and guide you step by step. I provide plenty of screenshots so you can see where everything is. I also like to focus on skills and techniques that you can apply to solve real-world problems.

Let's get started. I hope you find the material useful.
